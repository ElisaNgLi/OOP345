Reflection 8:

During this workshop reading about Raw pointers and Smart pointers were the key to actually completed this workshop. Also, going to some lectures notes and explanations really help me a lot during this workshop. In addition, knowing the differences between this two and how different they implement help a lot into not confusing which one was Smart or Raw. In this workshop I really learn how this two types of pointers work and the implementation of both of them.
