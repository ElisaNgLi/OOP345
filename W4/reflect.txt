Workshop 4 - Reflection
In this workshop I could understand more about move operators and how they work. 
Also, while coding the Message.cpp I encounter a lot of mistakes that I couldn’t understand at the beginning of why my output didn’t show the correct messages or why the @ sign was there. Then I realize that the way I was parsing it was wrong or some part of the functions was missing. 
Such as, when it was reading the document it would skip some lines or omit some characters.
