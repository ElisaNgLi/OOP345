Workshop 5 - Reflection

Trying to work and to understand the lambda function was a little bit complicated at the beginning but reading  through the notes and doing some research I could say that I have a better understanding on how it works and how it is supposed to be implemented depending on some cases or what we want to accomplish with the code.

While trying to submit this workshop on Matrix, I encounter some spacing issues with the output. This happened to me like the last workshop, so I just play around with the setw() part to see which number matches the Matrix script.
